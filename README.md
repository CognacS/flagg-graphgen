# FLAGG: Flexible Autoregressive Graph Generation

## Requirements

The code was tested with Python 3.11.7. The requirements can be installed by following these steps:
- Download anaconda/miniconda if needed
- Create a new environment through the given environment files with the following command:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f <env_file>.yml
    ```
    where \<env_file\> is the name of the environment file to use. It is possible to install dependencies for CPU with `environment_cpu.yml` or for GPU with `environment_cuda.yml`.
- Install this package with the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    which will compile required cython and c++ code.

## Experiments

### Reproducibility
For CUDA>=10.2, to run any experiments in a reproducible way, it is necessary to set the environment variable:
```bash
    export CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8
```
or in Windows, for cmd:
```bash
    set CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8
```
for PowerShell:
```bash
    $env:CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=":4096:8"
```
and to remove:
```bash
    Remove-Item Env:\CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG
```

### Running experiments
Configurations are composed of:
- a `task`, composed of a `dataset` and a `test` suite, defined by an assignment
- a `method`, defined by a `model`, a `trainer`, a `dataloader`, a `datatransform`, and a set of `callbacks`
- a `logger`, e.g., WandB or TensorBoard
- a `platform`, defining the computational resources to use

Presets can be defined in the `config/presets` directory, and experiments can be run by using the following command:
```bash
    python main.py +preset=<preset> seed=<seed>
```
where `<preset>` is the name of the preset to use, and `<seed>` is the seed to use for the experiment. The seed is optional, and if not provided, the experiment will be run with a default seed. Experiments are always run with reproducibility.

The presets inside this repository are the configurations for running the experiment of the paper. The directory `preset/ifh` is for Vanilla FLAGG, the directory `preset/sifh` is for the Sparse FLAGG, and `preset/mifh` is for the Property FLAGG.

#### Adding options
To concatenate options to a preset (found in `config/options`), simply add the following to your `python main.py` command:
```bash
    +options=<option>
```
where `<option>` is the name of the option to use (the file's name minus the extension). Multiple options can be concatenated by adding `+options=[<option1>,<option2>,...]` to the command instead.

#### Loading a checkpoint produces bad results: label remapping
Due to a known issue installing new datasets, when running experiments with provided checkpoints please add:
```bash
    +options=remap_cls
```
to your `python main.py` command. This will remap the model's labels to the dataset ones. Not doing so will result in bad model performance, as model labels are not the same as dataset labels, thus producing nonsensical generations.

#### Diffusion jumps
To experiment with diffusion jumps (speeding up generation at the cost of performance), add the following to your `python main.py` command:
```bash
    +options=djump_<jump_size>
```

#### Empirical sampling of graph node numbers
To sample the number of nodes in generated graphs from the empirical distribution of the training set, instead of the insertion+halt mechanism, add the following to your `python main.py` command:
```bash
    +options=node_empirical
```

#### Saving generative traces/chains
To save the generative traces/chains of the model, add the following to your `python main.py` command:
```bash
    +options=save_chains
```

### Datasets
Datasets will be downloaded automatically to a new directory ./datasets when running an experiment.

### Checkpoints and logging
Checkpoints are saved in a new directory ./checkpoints, and logging can be done through TensorBoard or WandB, which requires a free account to be used.

## Extending the code
The code can be extended by adding new datasets, test assignments, models, trainers, dataloaders, datatransforms, callbacks. The code is designed to be modular and easy to extend.

To register a new generator model it is sufficient to add a model file in the `src/models` directory (or any subdirectory), and to register the model using the `@reg_models.register()` decorator.
```python
from src.models import reg_models
from src.models.generator import Generator

@reg_models.register()
class MyGraphGenerator(Generator):
    def __init__(
            self,

            my_configuration: Dict,

            ######## passed by configurator ######
            dataset_info: Dict = None,
            test_assignment: Assignment = None,
            console_logger: Logger = None
        ):
        super().__init__(
            dataset_info=dataset_info,
            test_assignment=test_assignment,
            console_logger=console_logger
        )

        self.model = MyModel(my_configuration)

        # save hyperparameters
        self.save_hyperparameters(ignore=Generator.IGNORED_HPARAMS)

    # implement other pytorch lightning methods
    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        # implement training step
        pass

    def sample(self, num_samples: int) -> List[Graph]:
        # implement sampling method
        pass
```
